// What is the difference between OOP and POP?

1. OOP

->Object oriented.
->Program is divided into objects.
->Inheritance property is used.
->It uses access specifier.
->Encapsulation is used to hide the data.
->Object functions are linked through message passing.
->Adding new data and functions is easy
->The existing code can be reused.

2. POP

->Structure oriented.
->Program is divided into .unctios
->Inheritance doesn't allowed.
->It doesn;t use access specifier.
->No data hiding.
->Parts of program are linked through parameter passing.
->Expanding new data and functions is not easy.
->No code reusability.
