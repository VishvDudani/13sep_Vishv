1. What is SDLC? 
->SDLC stands for Software Devlopment Life Cycle. It's a methodology that defines the process of designing, writing, modifying, and maintaining software.
->SDLC is also known as the application devlopment life cycle. It's used in system engineering and software engineering to describe the process of planning, developing, testing, and deploying information systems.

2. Explain each phase of SDLC?
-> Requirement analysis :- gathering and defining the needs and specifications of the software.

-> Planning             :- estimating the resources, time, and cost of the project.

-> Software design      :- creating the architectural and detailed design of the software.

-> Software development :- writing and coding the software according to the design.

-> Testing              :- verifying and validating the software for functionality, quality, and performance.

-> Deployment           :- delivering and installing the software to the end-users.
